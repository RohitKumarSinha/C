1. A directed graph G, also known as digraph, is a graph in which every edge has a direction assigned to it. An edge of a directed graph is given as an ordered pair 
   (u, v) of nodes in G. 

   In linked list every node is pointer to another node same as in directed graph digraph, is a graph in which every edge has a direction assigned to it.


2. A graph is an abstract data structure that is used to implement the mathematical concept of graphs. it is basically a collection of vertices (also called nodes) 
   and edges that connect these vertices. A graph is often viewed as a generalization of the tree structure, where instead of having a purely parent-to-child 
   relationship between tree nodes, any kind of complex relationship can exist.

3. There are three common ways of storing graphs in the computer's memory. They are 
 
   * sequential representation 
   * Linked representation 
   * Adjancency multi-list 

   i should choose linked representation because in  linked representation by using an adjancency list that stores the neighbours of a node using a linked list 


5. By traversing a graph, we mean the method of examining the nodes and edges of the graph. there are two standard methods of graph traversal. these two methods are :
   
   * Breadth-first search
   * Depth-first search 

   while breadth-first search uses a queue as an auxiliary data structure to store nodes for further processing, the depth-first scheme uses a stack. But both these 
   algorithms make use of a variable STATUs. During the execution of the algorithm. every node in the graph will have the variable STATUS. during the execution of the
   algorithm, every node in the graph will have the variable STATUS set to 1 or 2, depending on its current state. 


10. Breadth-first search (BFS) is a graph search algorithm that begins at the root node and explores all the neighbouring nodes. Then for each of those nearest nodes, 

    The depth-first search algorithm progresses by expanding the starting node of G and then going deeper and deeper until the goal node is found, or until a node that
    has no children is encounterd. When a dead-end is reached, the algorithm backtracks, returning to the most recent node that has not been completely explored 

 
11. Topological sort of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G is defined as linear ordering of its nodes in which each node comes before all nodes to which it has outbound
    edges. Every DAG has one or more number of topological sorts 


12. A spanning tree of a connected, unidirected graph G is a sub-graph of G which is a tree that connects all the vertices together. A graph G can have many different
    spanning trees. we can assign weights to each edge (which is a number that represents how unfavourable the edge is), and use it to assign a weight to a spanning 
    tree by calculating the sum of the weights of the edges in that spanning tree.


14. prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that is used to form a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted undirected graph. In other words, the algorithm builds
    a tree that includes every vertex and a subset of the edges in such a way that the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. For this, the algorithm
    maintain three sets of vertices which can be given as below : 

    * Tree vertices
    * Fringe vertices 
    * unseen vertices 

15. kruskal's algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. The algorithm aims to find a subset of the edges that forms a tree 
    that includes every vertex. The total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. However, if the graph is not connected, then it finds a minimum spanning 
    forest. Note that a forest is a collection of trees. similarly, a minimum spanning forest is a collection of minimum spanning tree. 


16. Dijkstra's algorithm, given by a dutch scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1959, is used to find the shortest path tree. this algorithm is widely used in network routing 
    protocols, most notably IS-Is and OSPF(open shortest path first) 

    Given a graph G and a source node A, the algorithm is used to find the shortest path (one having the lowest code) between A (source node) and every other node. 
    moreover, Dijkstra's algorithm is also used for finding the costs of the shortest paths from a source node to a destination node.

    For example, if we draw a graph in which nodes represent the cities and weighted edges represent the driving distances between pairs of cities connected by a 
    direct road, then dijkstra's algorithm when applied give the shortest route between one city and all other cities .
